# Examples for deploying EFSS

In this repository, you can find examples of how to build images for your local EFSS deployment in Docker or in the Kubernetes environment. The examples describe the build including the patches and necessary integration application.

Currently, we have prepared the examples for **ownCloud deployment for CESNET QA environment**. If you want to use them you have to change the values accordingly.
